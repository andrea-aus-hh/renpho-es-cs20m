## Why?

I weight myself every day, when I wake up, and I keep track of my weight in a Google Sheet.
What often happens is that, in the short way between the scale and the toilet,
I forget to jot the weight down, and then I forget the weight itself.

Thanks to this, I just need to weight myself, and the Google Sheet will automatically get updated.
